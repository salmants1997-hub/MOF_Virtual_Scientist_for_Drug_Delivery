# MOF_Virtual_Scientist_for_Drug_Delivery
This Streamlit-based app acts as a virtual research assistant that analyzes scientific PDFs to identify Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for chemotherapy drug delivery. It simulates a 3-agent system:
Agent 1: Literature Scanner — Extracts and infers MOF properties from raw scientific papers.
Agent 2: Biocompatibility Filter — Filters MOFs based on safety and suitability for biomedical use.
Agent 3: Recipe Creator — Recommends synthesis procedures and evaluates each MOF's potential for targeted drug delivery.
The system is powered by Groq’s LLM API and provides structured output, including biocompatible MOF tables and synthesis steps, helping biochemists shortlist candidates for experimental validation.
